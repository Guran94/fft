I can't believe it turned out like that. I think we had more, but actually underestimated rebelien command. Our army didn't experience such a shameful defeat even in the first battle of the Philippines or Vietnam. It seems that the Vietnamese complex still persists and we lost again against the Communists. Except that this time we were fighting not the Vietcong, but the Soviets, which is a much bigger problem.
<br> <br>
Too bad for Redpoint. We shouldn't have been provoked. Command could realize it was a trap, moreover our shit we had here on the island couldn't be compared to the Russians. I hope that it will be over now, and that Russia will give us peace not to prolong the conflict yet, but perhaps the Soviet politbiro is not so stupid. I see it this way:
<br>
The Russians wanted to occupy the island, because they have always belonged to them in terms of history, so they have claims. I don't care about this shit of the world whatever they want, I don't mind shit that we lost. I am going home! But I still try to be calm, I'm superstitious.
<br>
Otherwise, I was commissioned to drive a truck. Mudaz is waiting for us at the airport at his jeep, so I mustn't miss him.
<br> <br>
At least I went through a war environment, so I enriched my military career after all.

Our domination on Everon is over, and after the UN has called us aggressors, we must leave the island. We tried to prevent this from happening. We negotiated, took a risky operation, but nothing happened good for us, so here we have a defeat, but we are not saved yet.
<br> <br>
You're one of the last who leaves Everon. The Russians have a direct order from the UN not to attack our troops because Malden is <a href="marker:q1">southwest of here</a>, so we have to fly across their territory.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:start">in Tyrone.</a>
