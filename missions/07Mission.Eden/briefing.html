I can't believe it turned out like that. I think we had more, but actually underestimated rebelien command. Our army didn't experience such a shameful defeat even in the first battle of the Philippines or Vietnam. It seems that the Vietnamese complex still persists and we lost again with the Communists. Except that this time we were fighting not the Vietcong, but the Soviets, which is a much bigger problem.
<br> <br>
Shame for Redpoint. We shouldn't have been provoked. Command could realize it was a trap, moreover we've got nothing here on the island and dispite this fact they wanted to break the Russians? I hope that it will be over now, but perhaps the Soviet politbiro would like to go further. I see it this way:
<br>
The Russians wanted to occupy the island, because they have always belonged to them in terms of history, so they have claims. I don't care about this shit of the world whatever they want, I don't mind shit that we lost. I am going home! But I still try to be calm, I'm superstitious.
<br>
Because I'm the only one of or group who can drive a truck, I received an order from Muday to stay until I do not unload everyone. The others have already left Everon, alhough Muday is waiting for us at the airport by his jeep, so I mustn't miss him.
<br> <br>
At least I went through a war environment, so I enriched my military career after all.

<p><a name="Plan"></a>
Our domination on Everon is over, and after the UN has called us aggressors, we must leave the island. We tried to prevent this from happening. We negotiated, took a risky operation, but nothing happened good for us, so we have a defeat here, but we are not saved yet.
<br> <br>
You're the last ones, who leave Everon. The Russians have a direct order from the UN not to attack our troops because Malden is <a href="marker:q2">southwest of here,</a> so we have to fly across their occupied territory.
<br><br>
You start <a href="marker:start">in Tyrone.</a>
