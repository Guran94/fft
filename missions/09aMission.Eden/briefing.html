I should not avoid <a href="marker:uniform">Montignac</a> to change the uniform because it's covered with blood.
<br>
Definetelly do not go <a href="marker:warning">here.</a> I've pointed this area like the one, where I've been captured and Lemontov is maybe still there.
<br><br>
<a href="marker:airport">The airport on the north</a> No can move there, but still it's an option. However a can't pilot a helicopter, perhaps I might to find a luck there.
<br><br>
<a href="marker:lamentin">Lamentin port</a> would be maybe the best choice to me, although steal the boat is impossible, I need a key to start the engine, in this case would be necessery to search for a commander in the town and convince him to give me a key.
<br><br>
<a href="marker:morton">Morton port,</a> there are apply the same conditions like in Lamentin, just choose the better desicion.
<br><br>
<a href="marker:pierre">Saint Pierre port</a> is the fartest and the most risky to get there, however if I feel courages a lot, I might choose, but perhaps with any issues.

The uniform is very tight to me, although hopefully it will save my life, it's leave up to me. I pointed the <a href="#main">possible evacuation places</a> on the map and where I am of course.
<br><br>
It's a long time ago I used to speak Russian, but I can do it, even if my identity would make me troubles. I've choosen the dress of some sort of sergeant Blashkov, because it's an officer and thanks to it I can make a respect among the Soviet soldiers.
<br><br>
However I have loaded the UAZ with weapons of the fallen Russians, so I have a great selection.

   <h6><a name="OBJ_1"></a>Propably this is my last chance to leave this cursed fucking island, then actually I have to think about my opportunities and do not show my ass to much, because there might be many Russians, who knew the real Blashkov, then I must be carefull I will talk with whom. The entire Everon is for me. The sole thing I have to do is carefully use my Russian language and create the right sollutions to leave the island and do not betray!
