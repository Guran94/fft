Why, why, why ... I keep repeating that in my head after yesterday's contact with the rebels. Why did they have to begin with us? Why couldn't the truck go a little faster, or why couldn't we leave the day before yesterday? I was sad and I am scared not only because of Muday. He will not let me be, he always goes after me. I am always the slowest, always I have to do more pushupps than other.
<br>
There are very few of us here, but we are the soldiers! They are just the people who took the weapons they didn't shoot in their lives. Civilians are forbidden to leave towns and villages. It's pointless to talk about farms, they are no longer under our control. Meanwhile, we're getting pretty good! I'll get back to that yesterday.
 <br><br>
The way we walked through the forest from the rebels yesterday, we can actually be happy. Elsewhere, there were five times as many in the forest and some areas are uncleaned. The sergeant repeated again and again not to get close to the <a href="marker:varovani">forests,</a> because the rebels are hidding there. I was quite taken by the situation we were not in. I hid in the trees, listening to the shots of my partners and my enemies. I just got to know the war environment.
<br><br>
We couldn't lose the contact accidentely. In my opinion either the rebels striked on it, or our guys have slept during the night, so we're going to have a big bitch, but a lot of the guys in my group are really dire. In fact, me too.
