STRM_m05v10,"James I'm just trying to say to you, that the Soviets are planning something and you should pay attention on them not on the rebels.","george"
STRM_m05v11,"Bullshit, George! The Russians fear us and NATO.\nNow we have to finish with this fucking theatre and take over the control over Everon again!","epgayd"
STRM_m05v12,"I have no fucking army here, George!\nI have no soldiers, tanks, helicopters, officers and more fucking, fucking, things...","epgayd"
STRM_m05v13,"As your deputy and Commander of BlackOps, I think it's a complete cause ...\nbut as your friend, I'll do everything I can to get you out of this porridge.","george"
STRM_m05v14,"Thanks, George. In the world, no one is better at solving problems than you.","epgayd"
STRM_m05v15,"Like I said, James, I'm gonna get you out of this and I'm going to the mess.","george"
STRM_m05v16,"I'm glad to hear it, George.\nThe meeting is in Morton. You'll receive briefing with our conditions and white flag, however you must to hand your HK.\nInstead take the Glock, just for sure.","epgayd"
STRM_m05v17,"It is going to be easier, than I expected.","george"
STRM_m05v18,"I'm going to Saint Phillipe. I will make contact with you. Your code name is Devil and I'll be Evil.\nI want to hear everything that the muther fuckers say.","epgayd"

STRM_m05v20,"Right now. The rebels are already waiting.","epgayd"

STRM_m05v24,"Do not worry sir. Break the leg.","guard"
STRM_m05v25,"That's my plan.","george"

STRM_m05v26,"Holy shit. So they fucked up here.","george"

STRM_m05v27,"Greetings the folk of Everon. It's a great honor the meet you personally.","george"
STRM_m05v28,"Does anybody speak english?","george"
STRM_m05v29,"Welcome, American. My names is Jean Poincare and yes I can speak english as you can see.","jean"
STRM_m05v30,"Poin-care... right. It's nice to meet you, mr Poincare.\nMy name is George Dyaconsen.","george"
STRM_m05v31,"So, take a seat, mr Dyaconsen.","jean"

STRM_m05v32,"You've got a very good accent, on Everonian, mr Poincare. Where have you learn so good english?","george"
STRM_m05v33,"I was in politics that's all, you may also not be interested.\nLet's get down to the business.\nSo what do you offer, Americans? What colonel Epgayd wants?","jean"
STRM_m05v34,"Mr. Poincare.\nThis conflict has cost a lot of human lives, as on our side and on yours too.\nTherefore, Colonel Epgayd and White House suggests ending this unnecessary war and establishing truce.","george"
STRM_m05v35,"Of course you suggest.\nYou came on Everon, made a mess, raped our women, including my wife... my wife mr. Dyaconsen!\nAnd now you want to finish it by the truce treaty? My wife was unguilty, mr Dyaconsen! Why she had to die?","jean"
STRM_m05v36,"I, I am so sorry, mr. Poincare... But not everyone American is like that.\nIf the conflict will continue, there are going to be more dead women on Everon, than your wife.","george"
STRM_m05v37,"You didn't understand it, American.\nThis island is ours and we want it back! We don't want more American liers of democracy here, but true free Everon!\nIf you can't understand it, the war will continue and it will be even your people, who will be dying.","jean"
STRM_m05v38,"And your women, who will have crying from the death of their sons.","jean"
STRM_m05v39,"Look, Mr. Poincare, I know Everon's people very good, I was drilling some our soldiers here.\nBut please look on it from other side. We had no choice, than come to your island.","george"
STRM_m05v40,"It's cold war crisis and if you will not drop your weapons, this conflict is getting bloodier.\nIf you think about your people, stop the war right now, make the situation calmer.","george"
STRM_m05v41,"Both sides will release the prisoners and neither one side has to not lose lives of its people.\nWe might be nemies, mr. Poincare, although I believe, that we might live as well.","george"
STRM_m05v42,"NO! Mr. Dyaconsen.\nThe war continues and with it the fight for freedom of Everon!","jean"
STRM_m05v43,"What was that?","george"
STRM_m05v44,"That's Russians, take cover!","jean"

STRM_m05v45,"Mr. Dyaconsen, get out of here. The negotiation is over. Just save your life!","jean"
STRM_m05v46,"But what about you?","george"
STRM_m05v47,"It's our business. Wait until it will stop and then go!","jean"
