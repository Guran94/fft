STRM_m08v17a,"Alright then. My name is Evgeni Kuznetsov.\nWhen I was 14 my parents escaped from Soviet Union with me to the USA.\nThey were rocket experts and they wanted to go for the better life and forget on everything from the red country.","jason"
STRM_m08v18a,"Hahaha, there is great cooperation with you, Yevgeny.\nYou know, I'm not a bad person. I do not blame you for betraying the great Soviet empire and rather join the other side of the barricade.\nI understand you, your family wanted to go for the better life.","lemontov"

STRM_m08v1a,"Earnestly? I am disappointed from the USA.\nMy parents and I thought we had a new, better world, but when I think about it, only the Soviet Union can give me a feeling of happiness and joy.\nAmerica gave me the opposite. I'm coming with you.","jason"
STRM_m08v2a,"Nice choice comrade Kuznetsov.\nI knew you choice right.","lemontov"

STRM_m08v1b,"I am Russian, but the meaning of that sentence gives the word ORIGIN.\nI don't want to be rude, but I have become an American and I will remain.\nI don't care about your fucking Bolshevik country.","jason"

STRM_m08v18,"Oh ... yeah, I got it. But I must not delay and move on.\nI should go deep into the forest where I definitely have a better chance of hiding than in the open. Maybe the Russians won't find me.\nPerhaps I'll meet other compatriots ... or more trouble.","jason"
STRM_m08v19,"Fuck I've slept! Fuck I have to go further!\n I'll try to reach end of this wood.","jason"
