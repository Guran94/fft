And it again goes into action. We had barely arrived in Lamentino and they are sending us to Morton this time. We didn't even relax.
<br>
In that truck, those nerds fucked with me off again. They just don't give up. They'll fuck me all the time! Ever since I started working here on Everon, I have been guarding my back against my partners. Now I don't know who hates me more? Platoon guys or rebels? Well, the rebels don't know I have Russian blood in me, so it's probably going to be a tie.
<br>
I'll let it go, I want to survive and I'm going to do my best! Today we have to support Morton, a strategic port. As if the weather did not like us. I haven't even remembered that awful thing, and it's awfully cold.
<br><br>
Diary, keep your fingers crossed for us, our first major operation in this conflict, perhaps it won't be as pale as it sounds.
