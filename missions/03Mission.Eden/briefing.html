And it again goes into action. We had barely arrived in Lamentin and this time they are sending us to Morton. We didn't have nor relax.
<br>
In that truck, those nerds fucked with me again. They'll fuck with me all the time! Ever since I started servising here on Everon, I have been guarding my back against my partners. Now I don't know who hates me more? Platoon guys or rebels? Well, the rebels don't know I have Russian blood in me, so it's probably going to be a tie.
<br>
I'll let it go, I want to survive and I'm going to do my best! Today we have to support Morton, a strategic port. As if the weather does not like us. I haven't even remembered that awful thing, and it's awfully cold.
<br><br>
Diary, keep your fingers crossed for us, our first major operation in this conflict, perhaps it won't be as pale as it sounds.

The rebels are stronger than we expected. The situation in Morton is very bad. The town is under siege for now and if we don't do anything, the enemy seizes it, which we cannot allow.

    <p>We suffered the first major defeat. The rebels introduced their secret weapon and used it against us. We didn't know at all, that they have tanks and payed for this mistake a huge defeat.</p>
