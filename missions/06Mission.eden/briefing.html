And it is here. A risky operation to weaken the Russians so much that they will not have the power to stay here on Everon and are likely to withdraw. I think the Soviets are waiting for us and ready. We send almost everything we have here, a few tanks, even less helicopters and a few of the infantry. A handful of soldiers are just guarding our bases.
<br> <br>
If this plan comes out, it will be a miracle, because I doubt that the Russians have brought less men to the island than we have now.
<br>
In any case, I got rid of Muday! He was promoted to lieutenant, so he was no longer in our group, but got into higher places. I don't care if he has a career and gets fucked. Instead, a young boy is now in charge of us, especially that he will not be bullying. But what is striking is that we have no officers here, so I am not quite sure who willlead the attack.
<br>
I have survived all these actions so far, so I hope this one will not be an exception, so for the first time in my life I shoot into the Russians.

A new enemy, a new problem. <a href="#operation">Operation Redpoint</a> has this name because of a Russian guest who managed to conquer <a href="marker:nepritel">partisan territory</a> in just a few hours.
<br>
We do not want to stay behind and even if there are very few of us here and we have heavy cassulties so we attack first.
<br><br>
The plan is simple: The only attack is to drive the Russians away from Everon.
