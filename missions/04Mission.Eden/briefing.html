Yesterday they ordered us to a small intersection that splits up the central from south Everon and built a camp here. Fortunately I have to not serve like guard by the MArshal law anymore and now we have got new orderes. I drew on a map <a href="marker:uzemi">the guerilla territory</a> and reflected in my mind under what circumstances it was acquired.
<br><br>
The war has not ended already I we have new task. Our HQ thinks, that the rebels want to strike on central Everon because of their <a href="marker:ukol2">hidding camps,</a> but not so hidding, we know it already. They've got some armored vehicles there so we will take care of it although still we must to avoid the forests, even through sergeant Muday offered to HQ, that we would risk it and go through out <a href="marker:les">the forest</a> south west from the <a href="marker:ukol1">first hostile camp</a> to not go round it and to have better cover behind the trees. He is so stupid idiot! Doesn't he? But HQ has accepted. What should I say?
<br>
Perhaps the command is right, and their troops are holding their leaders nicely in the three cities and pissing on the forests, but we'd better be careful not to hit any of the forest patrols.

On Everon we only endure defeats, today we will try to turn this series around.
<br>
The reacon company has discovered two hidden enemy camps and by its reports the rebels have got a several Russian tanks. The task is simple - destroy them earlier then they attack central Everon.
<br><br>
You start in  <a href="marker:start">Levie.</a> Due to the lack of APCs a truck will take your squad on the mission and unload you <a href="marker:unload">by the near forest.</a>
