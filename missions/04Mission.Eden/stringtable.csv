STRM_m04v02,"After such a big and surprising defeat, we did not have to recover for a long time, because another came and even bigger.\nAn uprising broke out in Lamentin.\nPeople took arms and with the help of rebels in the city took over the power.","Jason"
STRM_m04v03,"This put Le Moule in a pair of pliers.\nThe command ordered retreat from the city, but it was impossible.\nIt was impossible walk around the woods, so the rebels took advantage of it again and attacked. Our garrison in the city surrendered.","Jason"

STRM_m04v10,"Our casualties were bigger day by day. We had not a lot of soldiers and all the greenies.\nAfter the loss of three major cities we had more less tanks and helicopters.","Jason"
